SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (SRS) SOURCE MATERIAL
PROJECT: BioPulse - Real-Time Healthcare Monitoring System

1. INTRODUCTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 PURPOSE
    The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for "BioPulse," a web-based
    healthcare monitoring system. It allows doctors to monitor patient vital signs in real-time
    and receive immediate emergency alerts.

1.2 SCOPE
    BioPulse is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a remote patient monitoring
    environment.
    - Connects Patients, Doctors, and Administrators.
    - Simulates medical device data (Heart Rate, Blood Pressure, SpO2).
    - Broadcasts data instantly using WebSockets (Socket.IO).
    - facilitating rapid emergency response via an SOS feature.

1.3 DEFINITIONS & ACRONYMS
    - RBAC: Role-Based Access Control
    - MERN: MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
    - BPM: Beats Per Minute (Heart Rate)
    - SpO2: Oxygen saturation levels
    - SOS: Emergency distress signal
    - JWT: JSON Web Token (for secure authentication)

2. OVERALL DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 PRODUCT PERSPECTIVE
    The system is a standalone web application. It relies on a centralized server (Node.js)
    to manage socket connections between clients (React Frontend). Data is persisted in
    a MongoDB database.

2.2 USER CLASSES AND CHARACTERISTICS
    A. Patient
       - Users who wish to track their health and have a safety line to a doctor.
       - Technical skill: Basic web navigation.
    
    B. Doctor
       - Medical professionals responsible for monitoring assigned patients.
       - Requires verification (license upload) before accessing the system.
    
    C. Administrator
       - System overseers responsible for verifying doctors and maintaining system health.

2.3 OPERATING ENVIRONMENT
    - Server: Node.js runtime environment.
    - Client: Modern Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
    - Network: Active internet connection required for real-time WebSocket communication.

3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION
    FR-01: User Registration
           - The system shall allow users to register as Patient or Doctor.
           - Doctors must upload a verification document (image/PDF) during registration.
           - Phone number is mandatory for all users for emergency contact.
           
    FR-02: Login
           - The system shall authenticate users using Email and Password.
           - Unverified Doctors shall be prevented from logging in until approved by Admin.
           
    FR-03: Role-Based Access
           - Patients shall be redirected to the Patient Dashboard.
           - Doctors shall be redirected to the Doctor Dashboard.
           - Admins shall be redirected to the Admin Dashboard.

3.2 PATIENT MODULE
    FR-04: Vitals Simulation
           - The system shall simulate live vital signs (HR, BP, SpO2) and update the UI every few seconds.
           - Local history (last 10 readings) shall be visualized on line charts.
           
    FR-05: Real-Time Sync
           - The system shall define a WebSocket connection to broadcast vitals to the server.
           
    FR-06: Emergency Alert (SOS)
           - The system shall provide a distinct "SOS Alert" button.
           - Clicking SOS shall emit a high-priority event to all connected Doctors.
           
    FR-07: Doctor Association
           - Patients shall be able to view a list of available doctors and "Connect" with them.

3.3 DOCTOR MODULE
    FR-08: Active Patient Monitoring
           - Doctors shall view a grid of "Active Patients" currently online.
           - Vitals for each patient shall update in real-time (sub-second latency).
           
    FR-09: Emergency Notifications
           - The dashboard shall display critical alerts triggered by patients.
           - Alerts must include Patient Name, Phone Number, and Alert Type.
           
    FR-10: Patient List Filtering
           - Doctors shall only see detailed data for patients who have explicitly assigned them.

3.4 ADMIN MODULE
    FR-11: Doctor Verification
           - Admins shall view a list of "Pending Doctor Approvals".
           - Admins shall be able to view the uploaded proof document.
           - Admins shall perform "Approve" (grant access) or "Reject" (delete user) actions.
           
    FR-12: System Statistics
           - Dashboard shall display total count of Patients, Doctors, and Active Sessions.

4. NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.1 PERFORMANCE
    - Real-time updates should have a latency of under 200ms under normal network conditions.
    - The system should handle concurrent socket connections efficiently.

4.2 SECURITY
    - Passwords must be hashed (Bcrypt) before storage.
    - API endpoints must be protected via JWT tokens.
    - Doctor verification documents must be accessible only via authenticated routes.

4.3 RELIABILITY
    - The WebSocket connection should attempt auto-reconnect if dropped.
    - The system should fail gracefully if the database is unreachable.

4.4 USABILITY
    - The UI shall implement a "Dark Mode" / Glassmorphism aesthetic for reduced eye strain.
    - Critical alerts must be visually distinct (e.g., Red colors, Pulse animations).

5. SYSTEM INTERFACES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.1 USER INTERFACES
    - Frontend built with React.js using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
    - Icons provided by Lucide-React library.

5.2 SOFTWARE INTERFACES
    - Database: MongoDB (Atlas or Local Community Edition).
    - Web Server: Express.js exposing REST API and Socket.IO namespace.
